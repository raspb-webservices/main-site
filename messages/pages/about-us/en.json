  "aboutUs_modals_aboutMe_paragraph1": "Always technically interested, I started my journey into the digital world more than 20 years ago. Already during my computer science studies, I worked as a working student in technology companies, where I significantly supported marketing, maintained the company's online presence and created newsletters. For the following 10 years, I worked in various digital agencies: among other things, I built up a startup, was active in the SEO field for a corporation and helped a wide variety of companies achieve their business goals with strategic consulting, online marketing and application development...<br /><br />At the beginning of my career, I completed my studies (business informatics) part-time and was able to prove even in my early years that I function well even in times of enormous stress and pressure. During this time, I learned an incredible amount and was able to get to know many very different business models and industries.<br /><br />Looking for new, challenging opportunities, my career direction changed in 2018, and I have since been working in the field of enterprise software (with SAP) - in the broadest sense. A professionalization towards building digital workplaces for employees of larger companies, but also authorities, foundations, etc., has gradually taken place.<br /><br />We have built and further developed dozens of portals (from intranets to supplier portals to special employee platforms).<br /><br />Many systems, platforms and technologies (with and without SAP) were evaluated. So I have not only gained deep but also very broad insight into the IT needs of companies. In our fast-paced times, some things are already outdated before they have really proven themselves in use - but there are also many things that are always the same or very similar. My experience from various, very different IT projects enables me to develop most ideas and wishes quickly and cleanly. My skillset and know-how allow me to approach projects holistically (I take over concept/consulting, design, programming [frontend + backend] as well as all the administration around it). My profile is your competitive advantage. Solutions from a single source reduce project management efforts and ensure a coherent result. That this makes everything faster and cheaper, I don't need to mention here anymore.",

As a modern web development studio, we create innovative digital solutions that bring your vision to life.<br /><br />And who exactly is raspb? - Actually, it's just me and my AI crew ??",

  "aboutUs_introSection_titleSecond": "- your innovative IT service provider",
  "aboutUs_introSection_teaser1": "You can feel it intuitively - raspb is different. We are unconventional, we do things differently... We do them because they make sense, not because everyone does!<br />The demand for IT solutions for small and medium-sized companies remains strong. Large enterprises are also considering where and how IT budgets are allocated. Make or buy? Do it yourself or put it out to tender? The power of AI will shake up the labor market - and IT in particular - and brings many risks, but also opportunities.",
  "aboutUs_introSection_teaser2": "You don't have to identify and unlock the potential alone - bring an expert to your side. Not every AI promise turns out in practice to be what one imagined at the start. Many projects can be generated by a freely available AI with a single prompt. The results can be impressive. In the end, however, you still need experts to evaluate and contextualize the result - and to feed the AI model in a way that produces a secure, fast and maintainable outcome that creates joy instead of frustration. There are also countless low-code and no-code platforms and software providers out there - website builders - that promise professional results with little effort and cost. There are certainly use cases for that, but you should not forget that these are also just tools that must be operated. They cost time, effort, a learning curve and usually monthly fees. The results often turn out to be insufficient, and you give up individuality and flexibility. Unfortunately, the alternative - outsourcing the project to an agency or development studio - is usually very expensive and comes with long, stressful projects.",
  "aboutUs_introSection_teaser3": "This is exactly where raspb steps in. In project implementation, AI supports us (websites, CMS, apps). We can also realize AI use cases in your company together (AI agents, workflows, automations, ...)<br /><br />raspb is different, raspb is innovative, versatile, modern, fast, efficient, affordable, high quality, always there for you, personal, uncomplicated, flexible, reliable and so much more.
