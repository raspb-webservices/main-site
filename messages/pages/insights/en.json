  "insights_kiSection_paragraph1": "Artificial intelligence is an impressive tool that can speed up certain tasks by a factor of 10. It enables us to offer our tailor-made IT projects extremely efficiently (project duration, costs, etc.). But it does not work without people: creativity, experience, deep understanding of human needs, emotions... None of that can be replaced. In addition, you need experienced people who give the right instructions (prompts) to AI models and control their output. Sometimes AI delivers things you did not ask for (hallucinations) or results with serious errors. Even if many models can now create entire applications with a single prompt, a truly perfect result still requires a human expert.",
  "insights_kiSection_paragraph2": "Beyond prompt and context engineering (how can I best feed an AI so that exactly what I want comes out?), there are many other use cases where AI usage - in one form or another - is obvious: chatbots, AI agents, AI workflows, AI-enhanced automations, content creation, personal assistants, etc.",
  "insights_kiSection_paragraph3": "We discovered n8n as our automation platform. It allows us to implement scenarios from all areas of AI simply and efficiently. In addition to individual AI consulting services, we also offer the development of specialized agents and workflows that help you achieve your business goals and save costs. For our AI projects (and sometimes our custom development work), the standardized project process cannot be applied 100%. Project timelines are usually somewhat longer and closer coordination is required. And yet the unique raspb approach also delivers unique efficiency here. Results from AI projects are available much earlier than with other providers.",
  "insights_kiSection_title": "So what about AI?",

  "insights_meta_title": "Insights - raspb Webservices",
  "insights_projectInsights_paragraph1": "Your IT project starts directly on our website: the project configurator lets you describe your vision and lays the foundation for our collaboration. To use the configurator in full, all you need is a basic account – your email address is enough. Your configured project then appears in your personal dashboard, where you can refine it and submit it to us with a single click. At the same time you receive an email with all the details and can place your official order right away – that's where the journey begins.",
  "insights_projectInsights_paragraph2": "As soon as your order is in, we dive straight into concept development and build a first prototype. For every project we set up a dedicated mailbox at @raspb.de that is used for all relevant accounts; you can access it conveniently via browser or webmail. We create a GitHub repository for your code and set up a dedicated site on Netlify – depending on the project type complemented by accounts at Hygraph and Auth0, which you typically access via SSO through GitHub.",
  "insights_projectInsights_paragraph3": "We sharpen your vision together if needed in short workshops or compact web sessions. Our goal is a lean, efficient process without unnecessary, time-consuming meetings. The information from the configurator combined with our extensive project experience enables us to understand and implement your idea precisely without countless alignment loops. Should you have questions or want additional exchange between configuration and commissioning, we are always available – but always with a focus on a lean and mutually beneficial workflow.",
  "insights_projectInsights_paragraph4": "Throughout the development phase you have full access to all systems at all times. We build your project in the dedicated GitHub repository and publish ongoing results via a temporary .netlify.app address. You receive all credentials and are kept informed about every relevant step both in your dashboard and by email. For CMS projects we align the data model and special requirements with you in a few focused iterations, while straightforward websites typically need no additional rounds. You usually receive a first prototype within a few days; for complex applications or custom developments it may take a little longer until the first prototype is ready.",
  "insights_projectInsights_paragraph5": "In the next step you take your time to test the prototype and give us your feedback. Through the dashboard you can add further project artefacts at any time and actively shape the direction of development. Based on your feedback we move into revision and fine-tuning until, within a few more days, a go-live-ready version is in place. In agreement with you we publish the solution under your desired domain, alternatively deliver the code to you, or transfer the application to your target environment – at that point the project is officially complete.",
  "insights_projectInsights_paragraph6": "Thanks to our modular and extensible architecture, this is rarely the end – more often it marks the beginning of further expansion stages. Your solution can grow at any time with new features, integrations, or projects – and that is exactly what our approach is designed for.",

The sheer variety of possibilities makes it difficult to describe or showcase a typical raspb project.",
  "insights_showcase_description2": "Nevertheless, there are many satisfied clients who have collaborated with me on side-projects in the past. Solutions that run smoothly, reliably and with minimal maintenance – some of them for many years. I would like to present the projects that were built within the same technical framework (before the AI accelerator was introduced): Node.js LTS + SvelteKit + TailwindCSS + daisyUI (some also with Netlify, Hygraph and Auth0). Projects I realized as a solo developer alongside my main job. The tech stack and the foundation have proven themselves demonstrably across multiple projects and have been gradually refined towards our goals.",
