  "insights_kiSection_title": "So what about AI?",
  "insights_kiSection_paragraph1": "Artificial intelligence is an impressive tool that can speed up certain tasks by a factor of 10. It enables us to offer our tailor-made IT projects extremely efficiently (project duration, costs, etc.). But it does not work without people: creativity, experience, deep understanding of human needs, emotions... None of that can be replaced. In addition, you need experienced people who give the right instructions (prompts) to AI models and control their output. Sometimes AI delivers things you did not ask for (hallucinations) or results with serious errors. Even if many models can now create entire applications with a single prompt, a truly perfect result still requires a human expert.",
  "insights_kiSection_paragraph2": "Beyond prompt and context engineering (how can I best feed an AI so that exactly what I want comes out?), there are many other use cases where AI usage - in one form or another - is obvious: chatbots, AI agents, AI workflows, AI-enhanced automations, content creation, personal assistants, etc.",
  "insights_kiSection_paragraph3": "We discovered n8n as our automation platform. It allows us to implement scenarios from all areas of AI simply and efficiently. In addition to individual AI consulting services, we also offer the development of specialized agents and workflows that help you achieve your business goals and save costs. For our AI projects (and sometimes our custom development work), the standardized project process cannot be applied 100%. Project timelines are usually somewhat longer and closer coordination is required. And yet the unique raspb approach also delivers unique efficiency here. Results from AI projects are available much earlier than with other providers.",
  "insights_projectInsights_titleFirst": "What does a typical project at",
  "insights_projectInsights_titleHighlight": "raspb",
  "insights_projectInsights_titleSecond": "look like",
  "insights_projectInsights_paragraph1": "You can find the easy entry into your upcoming IT project on our website. By submitting the project configurator, the first major step is already done. To use the intelligent configurator in full, you only need to create a simple account (your email address is sufficient). The planned project then appears in your personal dashboard and can be refined there and ultimately submitted to us.",
  "insights_projectInsights_paragraph2": "You immediately receive an email with all details and can officially get started with a single click and commission us. <strong>This is where the journey begins!</strong> We immediately start working on your idea, develop a concept and a first prototype. For each project, we set up a dedicated inbox <projektname>@raspb.de, which is used to create all accounts. You get access to the inbox and webmail access via browser. A GitHub account is set up to host the project code, and a dedicated site in Netlify is created. Depending on the project type, a Hygraph and auth0 account may be added. Access is typically via SSO from the GitHub account.",
  "insights_projectInsights_paragraph3": "Depending on the project scope and customer preferences, we refine your vision together in small workshops or web sessions. What we definitely want to avoid is scheduling many time-consuming meetings that usually provide little value. Your input from the configurator, along with our extensive experience from IT projects, enables us to understand and implement your idea or vision without endless loops. If you are still unsure between configuration and commissioning, have questions or need dialogue for other reasons, we are of course always available. Let's keep it efficient and lean - for everyone's benefit.",
  "insights_projectInsights_paragraph4": "You have full access to all systems - even during the project. We now develop your project within the created GitHub repository and provide it under a temporary address: <projektname>.netlify.app. You receive all access data directly and are informed about every step in your dashboard and via email.",
  "insights_projectInsights_paragraph5": "For CMS projects, we run a few iterations with you to align on the data model and other details. Simple websites usually do not require additional coordination rounds. You receive a first prototype within a few days. For more complex projects, such as special applications or custom development, it can take a bit longer until we present the first prototype.",
  "insights_projectInsights_paragraph6": "You now have enough time to test the prototype and give us feedback. Via the dashboard you also have the option at any time to provide additional project artifacts or influence the development.",
  "insights_projectInsights_paragraph7": "With the collected feedback, we move into revision and polishing. After a few more days, the go-live-ready final version is available. In coordination with you, we publish the result under the desired domain. Alternatively, we deliver the code to you or transfer the application to your preferred location. The project is then successfully completed.",
  "insights_projectInsights_paragraph8": "But that's not all. Our solutions are modular, flexible and expandable. The end of your project is the beginning of another...",

  "insights_webtechnologien_absatz1headline": "What is Jamstack?",
  "insights_webtechnologien_absatz1": "<strong>Jamstack</strong> stands for JavaScript, APIs and Markup and represents a modern architecture for web development. This technology enables us to build extremely fast, secure and scalable websites and web applications that deliver an exceptional user experience.",
  "insights_webtechnologien_absatz2headline": "Unmatched performance",
  "insights_webtechnologien_absatz2": "The core of the Jamstack approach lies in <strong>pre-generation</strong> of content. Instead of generating pages dynamically on each request, all pages are generated at build time and delivered via a Content Delivery Network (CDN). This results in lightning-fast load times and improved performance. There are additional benefits as well.",
  "insights_webtechnologien_absatz3headline": "Decoupling frontend and backend",
  "insights_webtechnologien_absatz3": "By <strong>decoupling frontend and backend</strong>, we can flexibly choose the best tools for each area. The frontend is delivered as static files, while dynamic functions are implemented via APIs. This architecture offers several decisive advantages:",
  "insights_webtechnologien_absatz4headline": "Technology agnosticism",
  "insights_webtechnologien_absatz4": "Our Jamstack setup consists of modern and innovative tools and technologies that have proven themselves and are perfectly coordinated. A <strong>Node.js</strong> frontend application usually forms the foundation. Enriched with frameworks like <strong>Svelte/SvelteKit</strong>, <strong>TailwindCSS</strong> or <strong>DaisyUI</strong> and other npm packages, we create a frontend with endless possibilities.<br/><br/>We are not locked into a rigid construct, but can respond flexibly to integration requests or other technology questions. Almost anything is possible... Furthermore, we rely on <strong>TypeScript</strong> for type-safe programming and <strong>Netlify</strong> for deployment and hosting. This combination - supported by <strong>AI tools</strong> - enables us to develop robust and maintainable web applications optimized for both developers and end users.",
  "insights_webtechnologien_absatz5headline": "Headless CMS integration",
  "insights_webtechnologien_absatz5": "<strong>Headless CMS integration</strong> via GraphQL APIs enables our customers to manage content easily while the technical complexity remains hidden in the background. This lets you focus on your business while we ensure a technically flawless and future-proof solution.",
