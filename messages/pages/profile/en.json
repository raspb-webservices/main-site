It enables us to offer our tailor-made IT projects extremely efficiently (project duration, costs, etc.). But it does not work without people: creativity, experience, deep understanding of human needs, emotions... None of that can be replaced. In addition, you need experienced people who give the right instructions (prompts) to AI models and control their output. Sometimes AI delivers things you did not ask for (hallucinations) or results with serious errors. Even if many models can now create entire applications with a single prompt, a truly perfect result still requires a human expert.","insights_kiSection_paragraph2":"Beyond prompt and context engineering (how can I best feed an AI so that exactly what I want comes out?), there are many other use cases where AI usage - in one form or another - is obvious: chatbots, AI agents, AI workflows, AI-enhanced automations, content creation, personal assistants, etc.","insights_kiSection_paragraph3":"We discovered n8n as our automation platform. It allows us to implement scenarios from all areas of AI simply and efficiently. In addition to individual AI consulting services, we also offer the development of specialized agents and workflows that help you achieve your business goals and save costs. For our AI projects (and sometimes our custom development work), the standardized project process cannot be applied 100%. Project timelines are usually somewhat longer and closer coordination is required. And yet the unique raspb approach also delivers unique efficiency here. Results from AI projects are available much earlier than with other providers.","insights_projectInsights_titleFirst":"What does a typical project at","insights_projectInsights_titleHighlight":"raspb","insights_projectInsights_titleSecond":"look like","insights_projectInsights_paragraph1":"You can find the easy entry into your upcoming IT project on our website. By submitting the project configurator, the first major step is already done. To use the intelligent configurator in full, you only need to create a simple account (your email address is sufficient). The planned project then appears in your personal dashboard and can be refined there and ultimately submitted to us.","insights_projectInsights_paragraph2":"You immediately receive an email with all details and can officially get started with a single click and commission us. <strong>This is where the journey begins!</strong> We immediately start working on your idea, develop a concept and a first prototype. For each project, we set up a dedicated inbox <projektname>@raspb.de, which is used to create all accounts. You get access to the inbox and webmail access via browser. A GitHub account is set up to host the project code, and a dedicated site in Netlify is created. Depending on the project type, a Hygraph and auth0 account may be added. Access is typically via SSO from the GitHub account.","insights_projectInsights_paragraph3":"Depending on the project scope and customer preferences, we refine your vision together in small workshops or web sessions. What we definitely want to avoid is scheduling many time-consuming meetings that usually provide little value. Your input from the configurator, along with our extensive experience from IT projects, enables us to understand and implement your idea or vision without endless loops. If you are still unsure between configuration and commissioning, have questions or need dialogue for other reasons, we are of course always available. Let's keep it efficient and lean - for everyone's benefit.","insights_projectInsights_paragraph4":"You have full access to all systems - even during the project. We now develop your project within the created GitHub repository and provide it under a temporary address: <projektname>.netlify.app. You receive all access data directly and are informed about every step in your dashboard and via email.","insights_projectInsights_paragraph5":"For CMS projects, we run a few iterations with you to align on the data model and other details. Simple websites usually do not require additional coordination rounds. You receive a first prototype within a few days. For more complex projects, such as special applications or custom development, it can take a bit longer until we present the first prototype.","insights_projectInsights_paragraph6":"You now have enough time to test the prototype and give us feedback. Via the dashboard you also have the option at any time to provide additional project artifacts or influence the development.","insights_projectInsights_paragraph7":"With the collected feedback, we move into revision and polishing. After a few more days, the go-live-ready final version is available. In coordination with you, we publish the result under the desired domain. Alternatively, we deliver the code to you or transfer the application to your preferred location. The project is then successfully completed.","insights_projectInsights_paragraph8":"But that's not all. Our solutions are modular, flexible and expandable.

Already during my computer science studies, I worked as a working student in technology companies, where I significantly supported marketing, maintained the company's online presence and created newsletters. For the following 10 years, I worked in various digital agencies: among other things, I built up a startup, was active in the SEO field for a corporation and helped a wide variety of companies achieve their business goals with strategic consulting, online marketing and application development...<br /><br />At the beginning of my career, I completed my studies (business informatics) part-time and was able to prove even in my early years that I function well even in times of enormous stress and pressure. During this time, I learned an incredible amount and was able to get to know many very different business models and industries.<br /><br />Looking for new, challenging opportunities, my career direction changed in 2018, and I have since been working in the field of enterprise software (with SAP) - in the broadest sense. A professionalization towards building digital workplaces for employees of larger companies, but also authorities, foundations, etc., has gradually taken place.<br /><br />We have built and further developed dozens of portals (from intranets to supplier portals to special employee platforms).<br /><br />Many systems, platforms and technologies (with and without SAP) were evaluated. So I have not only gained deep but also very broad insight into the IT needs of companies. In our fast-paced times, some things are already outdated before they have really proven themselves in use - but there are also many things that are always the same or very similar. My experience from various, very different IT projects enables me to develop most ideas and wishes quickly and cleanly. My skillset and know-how allow me to approach projects holistically (I take over concept/consulting, design, programming [frontend + backend] as well as all the administration around it). My profile is your competitive advantage. Solutions from a single source reduce project management efforts and ensure a coherent result. That this makes everything faster and cheaper, I don't need to mention here anymore.","aboutUs_modals_aboutMe_imageAlt":"Markus Haertig","aboutUs_modals_aboutMe_name":"Markus Haertig","aboutUs_modals_aboutMe_role":"Managing Partner","aboutUs_markusSection_imageAlt":"Markus - Founder of raspb Webservices","aboutUs_modals_member_about":"About ...","aboutUs_modals_member_personality":"Personality","aboutUs_modals_member_experience":"Experience & Expertise","aboutUs_modals_member_coreCompetencies":"Core Competencies","aboutUs_teamMembers_alex_description":"Alex is our technical visionary and leads the development of complex web applications.

The power of AI will shake up the labor market - and IT in particular - and brings many risks, but also opportunities.","aboutUs_introSection_teaser2":"You don't have to identify and unlock the potential alone - bring an expert to your side. Not every AI promise turns out in practice to be what one imagined at the start. Many projects can be generated by a freely available AI with a single prompt. The results can be impressive. In the end, however, you still need experts to evaluate and contextualize the result - and to feed the AI model in a way that produces a secure, fast and maintainable outcome that creates joy instead of frustration. There are also countless low-code and no-code platforms and software providers out there - website builders - that promise professional results with little effort and cost. There are certainly use cases for that, but you should not forget that these are also just tools that must be operated. They cost time, effort, a learning curve and usually monthly fees. The results often turn out to be insufficient, and you give up individuality and flexibility. Unfortunately, the alternative - outsourcing the project to an agency or development studio - is usually very expensive and comes with long, stressful projects.","aboutUs_introSection_teaser3":"This is exactly where raspb steps in.

You can:<ul><li>continue working with raspb</li><li>hire another service provider</li><li>develop internally</li><li>end the project</li></ul><p>– without hidden rights or convoluted terms of use. During development, raspb retains control to avoid chaos, but there is no vendor lock-in.</p>","faq_questions_q9_title":"How does raspb use AI – and is it really safe and high-quality?","faq_questions_q9_content":"AI at raspb is a tool, not an end in itself. It is used to significantly accelerate design, code, testing, and documentation – always within a controlled environment and with an experienced developer as \"human in the loop.\" Critical areas such as security, architecture, data modeling, and performance are deliberately not blindly left to AI. The result: significantly faster implementation, but with a quality and security level that suits productive business systems.","faq_questions_q10_title":"What about data protection, GDPR, and legal matters?","faq_questions_q10_content":"raspb ensures that the services and integrations used can be operated in compliance with data protection regulations (e.g., data processing agreements, data-minimizing configuration, cookie consent, logging). Legal texts (imprint, privacy policy, terms and conditions if applicable) can be integrated through specialized providers or existing lawyers. Tracking, analytics, and third-party services are integrated in a way that is compatible with your data protection concept. In short: You don’t get a \"black box solution,\" but a transparent, legally conscious implementation.","faq_questions_q11_title":"Do you also offer maintenance, support, and further development after the project is finished?","faq_questions_q11_content":"Yes. raspb offers optional maintenance contracts with a clear scope of services: hosting & monitoring, security updates, bug fixes, and a monthly allowance for minor enhancements or content adjustments. Through your customer dashboard, you can request new features, report bugs, or start follow-up projects at any time. You decide whether you want to manage the system yourself or have raspb keep the reins permanently.","faq_questions_q12_title":"What happens if I want to switch providers or develop my project internally later?","faq_questions_q12_content":"That’s exactly what the model is designed for: The code is cleanly structured, based on modern web technologies, and can be understood and taken over by other developers. You don’t have to \"buy your way out\" and are not tied to a specific platform. If desired, raspb even supports you during the handover – for example, through technical documentation, training your team, or preparing the repository for the new partner.","faq_questions_q13_title":"What types of projects or industries do you decline?","faq_questions_q13_content":"raspb has clear boundaries: Projects from the defense industry (with the exception of sporting weapons), pornography, extremist or discriminatory content, as well as ventures that harm people or animals are fundamentally rejected. Likewise, projects that don’t fit the technical or organizational focus (e.g., classic native desktop/mobile apps without web relevance). This stance is deliberately chosen – it creates clarity and trust on both sides.","faq_questions_q14_title":"I already have a website or application. Can you take over or extend something existing?","faq_questions_q14_content":"In many cases, raspb first analyzes your existing solution: What can be meaningfully reused, and where does a clean restart on a modern foundation make sense? Some systems can be usefully connected via API or interface, while others hold you back permanently. The goal is always a solution that remains maintainable, performant, and affordable in the long term – if necessary, through the path of \"rebuilding with clean migration\" rather than patchwork.","faq_questions_q15_title":"I don’t know much about technology and AI – can I still work with you?","faq_questions_q15_content":"Absolutely. You bring your business, your goals, and your expertise – raspb translates that into technology. Everything is explained in plain language, without buzzword bingo. You decide for yourself how deeply you want to get into the technical side: from \"just make it work\" to training sessions where you can later manage content, users, or workflows yourself. The goal is always: You are empowered rather than dependent.","faq_question_form_heading":"Didn't find your question?","faq_question_form_description":"No problem – ask us your question directly.
