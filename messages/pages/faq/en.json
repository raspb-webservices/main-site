  "faq_questions_q10_content": "raspb ensures that the services and integrations used can be operated in compliance with data protection regulations (e.g., data processing agreements, data-minimizing configuration, cookie consent, logging). Legal texts (imprint, privacy policy, terms and conditions if applicable) can be integrated through specialized providers or existing lawyers. Tracking, analytics, and third-party services are integrated in a way that is compatible with your data protection concept. In short: You don’t get a \"black box solution,\" but a transparent, legally conscious implementation.",
  "faq_questions_q10_title": "What about data protection, GDPR, and legal matters?",
  "faq_questions_q11_content": "Yes. raspb offers optional maintenance contracts with a clear scope of services: hosting & monitoring, security updates, bug fixes, and a monthly allowance for minor enhancements or content adjustments. Through your customer dashboard, you can request new features, report bugs, or start follow-up projects at any time. You decide whether you want to manage the system yourself or have raspb keep the reins permanently.",
  "faq_questions_q11_title": "Do you also offer maintenance, support, and further development after the project is finished?",
  "faq_questions_q12_content": "That’s exactly what the model is designed for: The code is cleanly structured, based on modern web technologies, and can be understood and taken over by other developers. You don’t have to \"buy your way out\" and are not tied to a specific platform. If desired, raspb even supports you during the handover – for example, through technical documentation, training your team, or preparing the repository for the new partner.",
  "faq_questions_q12_title": "What happens if I want to switch providers or develop my project internally later?",
  "faq_questions_q13_content": "raspb has clear boundaries: Projects from the defense industry (with the exception of sporting weapons), pornography, extremist or discriminatory content, as well as ventures that harm people or animals are fundamentally rejected. Likewise, projects that don’t fit the technical or organizational focus (e.g., classic native desktop/mobile apps without web relevance). This stance is deliberately chosen – it creates clarity and trust on both sides.",
  "faq_questions_q13_title": "What types of projects or industries do you decline?",
  "faq_questions_q14_content": "In many cases, raspb first analyzes your existing solution: What can be meaningfully reused, and where does a clean restart on a modern foundation make sense? Some systems can be usefully connected via API or interface, while others hold you back permanently. The goal is always a solution that remains maintainable, performant, and affordable in the long term – if necessary, through the path of \"rebuilding with clean migration\" rather than patchwork.",
  "faq_questions_q14_title": "I already have a website or application. Can you take over or extend something existing?",
  "faq_questions_q15_content": "Absolutely. You bring your business, your goals, and your expertise – raspb translates that into technology. Everything is explained in plain language, without buzzword bingo. You decide for yourself how deeply you want to get into the technical side: from \"just make it work\" to training sessions where you can later manage content, users, or workflows yourself. The goal is always: You are empowered rather than dependent.",
  "faq_questions_q15_title": "I don’t know much about technology and AI – can I still work with you?",
  "faq_questions_q1_content": "raspb develops websites, web applications (PWAs), and AI solutions specifically for small and medium-sized businesses. Instead of \"never-ending IT projects,\" you get clearly defined product packages at fixed prices – from a simple one-pager to complex business applications with login, roles, dashboards, and more. Conception, design, development, hosting, and optional maintenance all come from a single source – without agency overhead and without website builder compromises.",
  "faq_questions_q1_title": "What exactly does raspb do?",
  "faq_questions_q2_content": "raspb is ideal for SMEs, freelancers, agencies with IT needs, associations, foundations, and social initiatives that want professional digital solutions but don’t have corporate budgets. You want to \"finally get things done\" and are looking for someone who takes responsibility rather than just advising. Less suitable are corporations with cumbersome processes, companies seeking classic strategy consulting without implementation, or projects that strictly require native apps, specialized legacy tech, or 24/7 enterprise support.",
  "faq_questions_q2_title": "Who is raspb the right choice for – and who isn’t it for?",
  "faq_questions_q3_content": "<ul><li><strong>Fixed prices instead of hourly billing:</strong> You know the total price before the project starts.</li><li><strong>Fewer meetings, more results:</strong> One point of contact, clear decisions, lean coordination.</li><li><strong>Full-stack from a single source:</strong> Concept, UX, UI, frontend, backend, AI – without ping-pong between departments.</li><li><strong>AI-powered efficiency:</strong> Many tasks are accelerated with AI, but always supervised by an experienced expert.</li></ul><p>You get agency-quality results, but faster, leaner, and at a significantly more attractive price.</p>",
  "faq_questions_q3_title": "How does raspb differ from traditional agencies?",
  "faq_questions_q4_content": "Website builders and low-code tools seem affordable at first glance – in reality, you often pay with your own time, limited flexibility, and vendor lock-in. With raspb, you don’t need to learn any tools or AI: You define the goals and framework, and we deliver the finished solution. The code belongs to you, and the project can be extended, migrated, or further developed by others. Plus: raspb pays attention to topics like performance, GDPR compliance, security, and maintainability – things that quickly fall by the wayside with \"one-click websites.\"",
  "faq_questions_q4_title": "How does raspb differ from website builders, low-code tools, or \"AI builds everything\" generators?",
  "faq_questions_q5_content": "Prices are transparent and based on actual effort, not on \"what the market will bear\":<ul><li>Simple one-pager / digital business card from approx. €399</li><li>Classic corporate website with multiple pages from approx. €999</li><li>CMS projects with self-manageable content roughly €2,000–6,000</li><li>PWA / business applications with login & logic typically in the range of €6,000–15,000</li></ul><p>Specific quotes are generated through a project configurator, so you know exactly what's included – and what it costs – before you start.</p>",
  "faq_questions_q5_title": "What does a website or web application cost approximately?",
  "faq_questions_q6_content": "<ol><li><strong>Getting to know each other & clarity:</strong> Brief conversation or form – we understand the goal, budget framework, and conditions.</li><li><strong>Configuration & quote:</strong> Your project is assembled in the configurator, including fixed price and rough timeline.</li><li><strong>Implementation:</strong> Design & development in a continuous environment – with progress updates in the customer dashboard.</li><li><strong>Fine-tuning & go-live:</strong> Feedback round, fine adjustments, technical launch.</li><li><strong>Optional: Maintenance & expansion:</strong> Ongoing support and further development through maintenance contracts upon request.</li></ol>",
  "faq_questions_q6_title": "How does a typical project with raspb work – from inquiry to go-live?",
  "faq_questions_q7_content": "Before the project starts, there is a clear fixed price – including a realistic buffer. There are no \"nasty surprises\" from added items, as long as the agreed scope remains the same. If something changes along the way (e.g., additional features), it is openly discussed and calculated separately. If delays occur that are not caused by you, raspb bears the additional costs – not you.",
  "faq_questions_q7_title": "What does \"transparent fixed prices\" mean specifically?",
  "faq_questions_q8_content": "Yes. After project completion, the complete code belongs 100% to you. The entire repository can be handed over to you. You can:<ul><li>continue working with raspb</li><li>hire another service provider</li><li>develop internally</li><li>end the project</li></ul><p>– without hidden rights or convoluted terms of use. During development, raspb retains control to avoid chaos, but there is no vendor lock-in.</p>",
  "faq_questions_q8_title": "Do I really own the code completely at the end?",
  "faq_questions_q9_content": "AI at raspb is a tool, not an end in itself. It is used to significantly accelerate design, code, testing, and documentation – always within a controlled environment and with an experienced developer as \"human in the loop.\" Critical areas such as security, architecture, data modeling, and performance are deliberately not blindly left to AI. The result: significantly faster implementation, but with a quality and security level that suits productive business systems.",
  "faq_questions_q9_title": "How does raspb use AI – and is it really safe and high-quality?",
